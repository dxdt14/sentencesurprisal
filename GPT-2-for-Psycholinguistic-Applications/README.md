# GPT-2-for-Psycholinguistic-Applications

The probability that a given stem (e.g., Joe mowed the [blank]) will be completed with a particular word (e.g., lawn) by a group of subjects is known as that word's cloze probability. This measure has been very useful in psycholinguistics as an index of the predictability of a word as it appears in context. Measuring cloze probabilities by directly surveying human subjects quickly becomes very expensive if you want to measure the contextual predictability of every word in a corpus. We can use the language model [GPT-2](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/) to get a reliable estimate of this probability:
