when the pizza finally arrived , it was almost doughy it was so undercooked !
they have a very different taste than the pizza .
i tasted the pizza and the crust was undercooked and burnt on the edges .
not a bready as the normal pizza so a plus in my eyes .
they use some oil which smell different that killed the taste of my pizza .
i was skeptical about feta and fontina on my pizza .
it was n't pizza i was smelling , or at least fresh pizza .

it 's just not my style of pizza .
i 'm a pizza traditionalist , but this was n't even really pizza .
it does n't look , smell or taste like pizza ! !
that went a long way for me with the pizza .

i grew up eating their pizza .
i grew up in dormont and thus grew up on campiti 's pizza .
had their pizza last night for my sons sleepover .
growing up in latrobe i had become accustomed to mediocre , chain pizza .
they have so many good dishes , but i wanted the pizza last night .
that said , i still have dreams about campiti 's pizza .
i 've dreamed of their pizza since i was a child .
i have been eating beto 's pizza since i was a little girl .
my favorite pizza was and still is campiti 's .
i 've been eating campiti 's pizza most of my life .
pizza bagels are a must !
i appreciated that they put the pizza in the paper bags .
thank you buck 's for the bag pizza .
i 've had much better wood-fired pizza elsewhere .
i feel like its better than a lot of other chain pizza places .
the beer list was better than most pizza places i 've been too .

i 'm a huge pizza snob , and fuel really holds up well .
i am torn on this late night pizza joint .

i love fuel as a post-1am drunken pizza spot .
large take out pepperoni pizza filled a delicious hole on a really cold night !
i got `` joe 's '' pizza .
had this pizza been cooked , i feel like it would be subpar .
so how did the pizza taste ?
if you want a simple pizza - i.e .
they put more toppings on pizza than any other place that i know .
random pizza toppings on lettuce ) this time around .
this is the kind of pizza that you need to eat with a spoon .
so , yes , you will eat your pizza with uncooked cheese on it .
i 'm a pizza minimalist .
for the money i expect that the toppings will be cooked on the pizza .
a real craving-type pizza with an acquired taste .
the pizza is what you would expect ... marginal at best .
the pizza is decent , and i like their sauce .
pretty good but i still prefer a vinnys pizza over anything .
i really like the pizza and marinated vegetables .
i just like the pizza .
i like the pizza size options .
i like the pizza and the selection of toppings .
i do like the pizza though .
i have to recommend the pizza .

i highly recommend this pizza .
i like the sausage pizza here as well .
i recommend the cheese pizza .
i see yummy pizza in our future .
and the rest of the bites until the pizza was done were equally happy .
my daughter and i ordered my pizza slices to eat in and hers togo .
today , if my family is eating pizza we are eating mineo 's .
my hubby asked me if i got an extra large pizza lol .
it would be awesome if they offered walk in pizza slices for lunch .
get a square pizza and a family of four can eat for days !
they sell pizza by the slice over the lunch hour ( maybe all day ?
even my kids will eat sushi over a piece of pizza .
the pizza i tasted , reminded me of a few spots in manhattan .
casey 's breakfast pizza was my katrina .
to put it frankly , campitis is the place to get pizza and hoagies .
what happened to the legacy don campitis pizza ?
i did it myself when i worked at a pizza shop years ago .
i should have stayed home and made pizza myself .
all my complaints aside , i did enjoy my pizza .
i was raised form new york and a very particular taste for pizza .
my pizza really hit the spot .
but i absolutely love the pizza and the whipped balsamic dressing .
i love the combination of freshly grated cheeses and homemade pizza sauce .
my friend always has the pizza and says it is really good .
this is always a good choice for pizza !
delivery is reliable , and pizza always dependable good .
but either way the pizza is always great .
i usually get a cheese pizza , but it 's so good .
stifled my pizza fix but i found the sauce a little too sweet .
this pizza felt like i was eating a pound of cheese mixed with sauce .
the pizza sauce was a bit tart for me .
the pizza came out and i was a fan of the sweet tomato sauce .
i tried a little of the margherita pizza , and it was not good .
if you do n't order this pizza ... you fucking suck .
i am feeling pretty defeated by this pizza , both in brain and bung .
still kick butt pizza but get rid of the cheese hoagie .
if you want terrible pizza go here .
therefore -- three stars , with the pizza saving the review from total damnation .
the pizza is only mediocre .
i had the pizza and it was mediocre at best .
the pizzas my husband and i ordered were mediocre .
i thought the pizza was `` eh . ''
update - went back another time and the pizza was mediocre at best .
reminded me of a bad cici 's style pizza .
the pizza was nice and hot , but was mediocre in taste .
pizza was mediocre btw
it reminded me of a stouffer 's french bread pizza .
i thought the pizza was a novelty .
however , the pizza improved a somewhat mediocre appetizer .
second-degree burns notwithstanding , the pizza was tasty !
i will probably always eat this pizza whenever i come .
the pizza which is what we always get is terrific too .
they are fast and consistent in quality and the pizza is always great .
i always pick up a pizza when i am near bellevue .

a couple years ago i had heard they smoke over making their pizza .
mmm ... even thinking about their pizza makes me crave it .
for a more grown up taste ; ) try the pizzas or pimento cheese !
i 've been on a good pittsburgh pizza hunt .
go to veltre 's pizza .
if you 're looking for a unique pizza experience , definitely try beto 's .
i recommend this pizza for dine in or carry out .
average pizza at best and sub-par appetizers .
fortunately , beto 's pizza tastes better .
i love beto 's pizza !
recommend for a dive pizza meal .
definitely , have to visit tony 's pizza .
